# Dice Roll Simulation

### Problem Statement

A die simulator generates a random number from `1` to `6` for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number i more than `rollMax[i]` (1-indexed) consecutive times.

Given an array of integers `rollMax` and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact `n` rolls. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo  `10``<sup>9</sup>` `+` `7`.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: 34
Explanation: There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.
```
#### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 30
```
#### Example 3:

```
Input: n = 3, rollMax = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 181
```
#### Constraints:

* `1 <= n <= 5000`
* `rollMax.length == 6`
* `1 <= rollMax[i] <= 15`
