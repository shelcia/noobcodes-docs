#Binary Tree Maximum Sum Path

###Problem Statement
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

 

###Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.


###Example 2:


Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
 

###Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10^4].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000


###Code:
class Solution:
  def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    ans = -math.inf

    def maxPathSumDownFrom(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
      nonlocal ans
      if not root:
        return 0

      l = max(0, maxPathSumDownFrom(root.left))
      r = max(0, maxPathSumDownFrom(root.right))
      ans = max(ans, root.val + l + r)
      return root.val + max(l, r)

    maxPathSumDownFrom(root)
    return ans
