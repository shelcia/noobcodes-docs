# Number of Islands

### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

#### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

### Code

```jsx title="Python Code"
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid: return 0
        row = len(grid)
        col = len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        count = 0
        directions=[(-1,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1)]
        def findIsland(x,y):
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                if 0<=nx<row and 0<=ny<col and grid[nx][ny]=='1' and (nx,ny) not in visited:
                    visited.add((nx,ny))
                    findIsland(nx,ny)

        for x in range(row):
            for y in range(col):
                if grid[x][y] == '1' and (x,y) not in visited:
                    count +=1
                    visited.add((x,y))
                    findIsland(x,y)
        return count
```
