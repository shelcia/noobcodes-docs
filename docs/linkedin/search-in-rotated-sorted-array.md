# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

### Problem Statement

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct values**).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in `nums`_.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

#### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-10`<sup>4</sup>` <= nums[i] <= 10`<sup>4</sup>
- All values of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- `-10`<sup>4</sup>` <= target <= 10`<sup>4</sup>

### Code

```python title="Python"
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return -1

        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid

            # Left position
            if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
                # if target is between start & mid, make right to (mid -1)
                if nums[left] <= target <= nums[mid]:
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    left = mid + 1

            # Right position
            else:
                # if target is between mid & end, make start to (mid + 1)
                if nums[mid] <= target <= nums[right]:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1

        return -1
```
