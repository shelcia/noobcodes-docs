# Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

### Problem Statement

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length `2`.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only **constant extra space**.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

#### Constraints:

- `2` `<=` `numbers.length` `<=` 3 \* 10<sup>4</sup>
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.

### Code

```python title="Python Code"

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers)-1
        while l != r:
            if numbers[r] + numbers[l] == target: return [l+1, r+1]
            if numbers[r] + numbers[l] > target: r -= 1
            else: l += 1
```
