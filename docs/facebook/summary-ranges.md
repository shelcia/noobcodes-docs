# Summary Ranges

### Problem Statement

You are given a sorted unique integer array `nums`.

A range `[a,b]` is the set of all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive).

Return the smallest sorted `list` of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x`such that`x`is in one of the ranges but not in`nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

- `"a->b" if a != b`
- `"a" if a == b`

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges)

#### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,2] --> "0->2"
[4,5] --> "4->5"
[7,7] --> "7"
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,0] --> "0"
[2,4] --> "2->4"
[6,6] --> "6"
[8,9] --> "8->9"
```

#### Constraints:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 20`
- `-2`<sup>31</sup> `<=` `nums[i]` `<=` `2`<sup>31</sup> `-1`
- All the values of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted in **ascending order**.

### Code

```python title="Python Code"

class Solution:
    def summaryRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        ranges = []
        for n in nums:
            if not ranges or n > ranges[-1][-1] + 1:
                ranges += [],
            ranges[-1][1:] = n,
        return ['->'.join(map(str, r)) for r in ranges]
```
