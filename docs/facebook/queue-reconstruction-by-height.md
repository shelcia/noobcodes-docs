# Queue Reconstruction by Height

### Problem Statement

You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>] represents the i<sup>th</sup> person of height h<sub>i</sub> with exactly k<sub>i</sub> other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to h<sub>i</sub>.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hh<sub>j</sub>, kh<sub>j</sub>] is the attributes of the j<sup>th</sup> person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height)

#### Example 1:

```
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

#### Constraints:

- 1 <= people.length <= 2000
- 0 <= hi <= 10<sup>6</sup>
- 0 <= ki < people.length
- It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

### Code

```python title="Python Code"
class Solution(object):
    def reconstructQueue(people):
        res = []
        for x,y in sorted(people, key=lambda x:(-x[0], x[1])):
            res[y:y] = [[x,y]]
        return res
```
