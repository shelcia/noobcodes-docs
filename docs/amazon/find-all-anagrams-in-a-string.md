# Find All Anagrams in a String

### Problem Statement

Given two strings **s** and **p**, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in **s**. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"

Output: [0,6]
```

##### Explanation:

- The substring with start `index = 0` is **"cba"**, which is an anagram of "abc".
- The substring with start `index = 6` is **"bac"**, which is an anagram of **"abc"**.

#### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"

Output: [0,1,2]
```

##### Explanation:

- The substring with start `index = 0` is **"ab"**, which is an anagram of **"ab"**.
- The substring with start `index = 1` is **"ba"**, which is an anagram of **"ab"**.
- The substring with start `index = 2` is **"ab"**, which is an anagram of **"ab"**.

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length`, `p.length` `<=` 3 \* 10<sup>4</sup>
- **s** and **p** consist of _lowercase_ English letters.

### Code

```python title="Python Code"

class Solution(object):
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        hm, res, pL, sL = defaultdict(int), [], len(p), len(s)
        if pL > sL: return []

        # build hashmap
        for ch in p: hm[ch] += 1

        # initial full pass over the window
        for i in range(pL-1):
            if s[i] in hm: hm[s[i]] -= 1

        # slide the window with stride 1
        for i in range(-1, sL-pL+1):
            if i > -1 and s[i] in hm:
                hm[s[i]] += 1
            if i+pL < sL and s[i+pL] in hm:
                hm[s[i+pL]] -= 1

            # check whether we encountered an anagram
            if all(v == 0 for v in hm.values()):
                res.append(i+1)

        return res

```
