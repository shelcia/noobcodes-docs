# Alien Dictionary - Verification

### Problem Statement

In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/description/)

#### Example :

```
Example 1:
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

Example 3:
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 20
order.length == 26
All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.

```

### Code

```jsx title="Python Code"
class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        order_map = {}
        for index, val in enumerate(order):
            order_map[val] = index

        for i in range(len(words) - 1):

            for j in range(len(words[i])):
                # If we do not find a mismatch letter between words[i] and words[i + 1],
                # we need to examine the case when words are like ("apple", "app").
                if j >= len(words[i + 1]): return False

                if words[i][j] != words[i + 1][j]:
                    if order_map[words[i][j]] > order_map[words[i + 1][j]]: return False
                    # if we find the first different character and they are sorted,
                    # then there's no need to check remaining letters
                    break

        return True
```
