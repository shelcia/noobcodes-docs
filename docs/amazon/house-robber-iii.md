# House Robber III

### Problem Statement

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii)

#### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

#### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10<sup>4</sup>].
- `0` `<=` `Node.val` `<=` 10<sup>4</sup>

### Code

```python title="Python Code"
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root:
            return 0
        self.max = 0
        self.rob_tree(root)
        return self.max

    def rob_tree(self, node):
        if not node:
            return 0, 0, 0
        l_son, l_grandson_l, l_grandson_r = self.rob_tree(node.left)
        r_son, r_grandson_l, r_grandson_r = self.rob_tree(node.right)
        cur_max = max(node.val + l_grandson_l + l_grandson_r + r_grandson_l +
                      r_grandson_r, l_son + r_son)
        if cur_max > self.max:
            self.max = cur_max
        return cur_max, l_son, r_son
```
